Author Carpentry : Docker for reproducible research
=======

Reproducibility of computational results is crucial in modern algorithm-based research.
In this lesson, we introduce Docker as a useful tool to (a) document your computational environment, and (b) make a computational environment transferable across machines and thus archivable.
